       " 'The Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL) has emerged as the de facto standard for implementing business processes. At the same time, Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is being applied to the field of business process engineering by separating business logic from the underlying platform technology. However, due to the challenge of mapping graph-oriented modeling languages to block-structured ones and the informal description of UML 2.0 Activity Diagram (AD) and BPEL, transforming AD models to executable BPEL code is not trivial. This paper proposes an approach to transform AD to BPEL and paves the way for further general transformation between graph-oriented and block-structured process modeling languages. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

       " 'The status quo of prohibiting broadband service providers from charging websites for preferential access to their customers-the bedrock principle of net neutrality (NN)-is under fierce debate. We develop a game-theoretic model to address two critical issues of NN: (1) Who are gainers and losers of abandoning NN? (2) Will broadband service providers have greater incentive to expand their capacity without NN? We find that if the principle of NN is abolished, the broadband service provider stands to gain from the arrangement, as a result of extracting the preferential access fees from content providers. Content providers are thus left worse off, mirroring the stances of the two sides in the debate. Depending on parameter values in our framework, consumer surplus either does not change or is higher in the short run. When compared to the baseline case under NN, social welfare in the short run increases if one content provider pays for preferential treatment but remains unchanged if both content providers pay. Finally, we find that the incentive to expand infrastructure capacity for the broadband service provider and its optimal capacity choice under NN are higher than those under the no-net-neutrality (NNN) regime, except in some specific cases. Under NN, the broadband service provider always invests in broadband infrastructure at the socially optimal level but either under- or overinvests in infrastructure capacity in the absence of NN. © 2011 INFORMS.

       " 'Recent advances in electronics and telecommunication have paved the way for service robots to enter the clinical world. While service robotics has long been a core research theme in computer science and other engineering-related fields, it has attracted little interest of Information Systems (IS) researchers so far. We argue that service robotics represents an interesting area of investigation, especially for healthcare, since current research lacks a thorough examination of socio-technical problems and contextual influencing factors. This study identifies current research thrusts and delineates possible areas for theoretical, empirical, or design-oriented research for IS scholars. By means of a systematic literature review, we explore the current use, users, and utility of service robots in healthcare. Based on these findings, we suggest research topics that have the potential to be of practical significance. Our aim is to make substantive steps towards establishing service robotics as new research theme in information systems research.

The structure and information requirements that are needed to provide a classification system of quality costs were identified and discussed. The developed system was tested and implemented in two case study construction projects to determine the information and management issues needed to develop PROMQACS into a software program. In addition, the system was used to determine the cost and causes of rework that occurred in the projects. It is suggested that project participants can use the information in PROMQACS to identify shortcomings in their project-related activities and therefore take the appropriate action to improve their management practices in future projects.

       " 'Environmental sustainability is one of the most important topics of our time. Energy consumption is a significant aspect of environmental sustainability, as it is a major source of pollution. In order to determine how information systems can assist organizations in reducing energy consumption, we first identify energy-related activities of organizations by examining the content of 4,999 sustainability reports that communicate corporate activities directed toward sustainability. We use latent semantic analysis (LSA) to extract the most prominent topics discussed in these reports and the concept of affordances in order to portray the potential role of information systems in supporting these activities. We identify five such affordances: (1) balancing supply and demand with consideration of the energy price; (2) capturing, reporting, and sharing energy-related data; (3) reducing energy consumption and emissions; (4) sustainable waste management; and (5) coordination of flexible charging of electric vehicles. These affordances support energy management through information systems in practice and set a foundation for further research in the important field of energy informatics.

       " \"Information security has become increasingly important to organizations. Despite the prevalence of technical security measures, individual employees remain the key link - and frequently the weakest link - in corporate defenses. When individuals choose to disregard security policies and procedures, the organization is at risk. How, then, can organizations motivate their employees to follow security guidelines? Using an organizational control lens, we build a model to explain individual information security precaution-taking behavior. Specific hypotheses are developed and tested using a field survey. We examine elements of control and introduce the concept of mandatoriness, which we define as the degree to which individuals perceive that compliance with existing security policies and procedures is compulsory or expected by organizational management. We find that the acts of specifying policies and evaluating behaviors are effective in convincing individuals that security policies are mandatory. The perception of mandatoriness is effective in motivating individuals to take security precautions, thus if individuals believe that management watches, they will comply. © 2009 Operational Research Society Ltd.

These hypotheses promise a richer theoretical network that describes the role and importance of participation and involvement in the implementation process. Rethinking the concept of user involvement', 'The Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL) has emerged as the de facto standard for implementing business processes. At the same time, Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is being applied to the field of business process engineering by separating business logic from the underlying platform technology. However, due to the challenge of mapping graph-oriented modeling languages to block-structured ones and the informal description of UML 2.0 Activity Diagram (AD) and BPEL, transforming AD models to executable BPEL code is not trivial.

User-centered, device-aware multimedia content adaptation for mobile WEB\", 'The status quo of prohibiting broadband service providers from charging websites for preferential access to their customers-the bedrock principle of net neutrality (NN)-is under fierce debate. We develop a game-theoretic model to address two critical issues of NN: (1) Who are gainers and losers of abandoning NN? (2) Will broadband service providers have greater incentive to expand their capacity without NN? We find that if the principle of NN is abolished, the broadband service provider stands to gain from the arrangement, as a result of extracting the preferential access fees from content providers. Content providers are thus left worse off, mirroring the stances of the two sides in the debate. Depending on parameter values in our framework, consumer surplus either does not change or is higher in the short run. When compared to the baseline case under NN, social welfare in the short run increases if one content provider pays for preferential treatment but remains unchanged if both content providers pay. Finally, we find that the incentive to expand infrastructure capacity for the broadband service provider and its optimal capacity choice under NN are higher than those under the no-net-neutrality (NNN) regime, except in some specific cases. Under NN, the broadband service provider always invests in broadband infrastructure at the socially optimal level but either under- or overinvests in infrastructure capacity in the absence of NN. © 2011 INFORMS.

While service robotics has long been a core research theme in computer science and other engineering-related fields, it has attracted little interest of Information Systems (IS) researchers so far. We argue that service robotics represents an interesting area of investigation, especially for healthcare, since current research lacks a thorough examination of socio-technical problems and contextual influencing factors. This study identifies current research thrusts and delineates possible areas for theoretical, empirical, or design-oriented research for IS scholars. By means of a systematic literature review, we explore the current use, users, and utility of service robots in healthcare.

Energy consumption is a significant aspect of environmental sustainability, as it is a major source of pollution. In order to determine how information systems can assist organizations in reducing energy consumption, we first identify energy-related activities of organizations by examining the content of 4,999 sustainability reports that communicate corporate activities directed toward sustainability. We use latent semantic analysis (LSA) to extract the most prominent topics discussed in these reports and the concept of affordances in order to portray the potential role of information systems in supporting these activities. We identify five such affordances: (1) balancing supply and demand with consideration of the energy price; (2) capturing, reporting, and sharing energy-related data; (3) reducing energy consumption and emissions; (4) sustainable waste management; and (5) coordination of flexible charging of electric vehicles. These affordances support energy management through information systems in practice and set a foundation for further research in the important field of energy informatics.

Despite the prevalence of technical security measures, individual employees remain the key link - and frequently the weakest link - in corporate defenses. When individuals choose to disregard security policies and procedures, the organization is at risk. How, then, can organizations motivate their employees to follow security guidelines? Using an organizational control lens, we build a model to explain individual information security precaution-taking behavior. Specific hypotheses are developed and tested using a field survey. We examine elements of control and introduce the concept of mandatoriness, which we define as the degree to which individuals perceive that compliance with existing security policies and procedures is compulsory or expected by organizational management. We find that the acts of specifying policies and evaluating behaviors are effective in convincing individuals that security policies are mandatory. The perception of mandatoriness is effective in motivating individuals to take security precautions, thus if individuals believe that management watches, they will comply. © 2009 Operational Research Society Ltd.

TicketMonster is a deal-of-the-day coupon site which utilizes the Internet and mobile infrastructure to offer deals in Seoul and other cities around Korea on services at restaurants, cafes, spas, and so forth. Following the company's rapid expansion, management made the decision to expand the scope of TicketMonster beyond Korea's borders with the aim of taking on other Asian markets. To this end, TicketMonster acquired Everyday.com.my, the biggest social shopping site in Malaysia. However, it was believed that simply competing in markets across Asia would not enable TicketMonster to claim sufficient market share in light of the international expansion of Groupon and LivingSocial, two online daily deal global giants. Furthermore, competition in the online daily deal sector in Korea had escalated as local, regional and international players vied for consumer awareness and loyalty. On top of an advertising war, competition grew to the point where several sites began selling coupons while knowingly taking a loss by lowering commissions in order to attract competitive products or services for their respective deals and at times paying for the services themselves. In mid-2011, U.S.-based LivingSocial made an offer to buy TicketMonster in order to strengthen its presence in Asia.

Despite a proliferation of literature on knowledge sharing, most studies focused on such practice within an organization. The question of how to achieve effective interorganizational knowledge sharing remains unanswered. This study intends to answer this research question using the results from a case study of a software implementation project. Collaboration between software vendors and clients in information systems development/implementation projects require considerable amount of knowledge exchange between the partners. Differences in organizational culture, knowledge domain, as well as other critical factors, pose major challenge for interorganizational knowledge sharing. To be able to observe the impact of these critical factors on interorganizational knowledge sharing, the knowledge sharing processes between organizations should first be thoroughly explored.

We argue that the traditional orientation of these methodologies, towards the identification and assessment of technical information assets, obscures key risks associated with the cultivation and deployment of organisational knowledge. Our argument is developed through an illustrative case study in which a well-documented methodology is applied to a complex data back-up process. This process is seen to depend, in subtle and often informal ways, on knowledge to sustain operational complexity, handle exceptions and make frequent interventions. Although typical information security methodologies identify people as critical assets, we suggest a new approach might draw on more detailed accounts of individual knowledge, collective knowledge, and their relationship to organisational processes. Drawing on the knowledgemanagement literature, we suggest mechanisms to incorporate these knowledge-based considerations into the scope of information security risk methodologies. © 2009 Piya Shedden, Wally Smith, Rens Scheepers and Atif Ahmad.

One of the best understood ways to use data to improve decision making is via predictive analytics. An important, open question is: to what extent do larger data actually lead to better predictive models? In this article we empirically demonstrate that when predictive models are built from sparse, fine-grained data - such as data on low-level human behavior - we continue to see marginal increases in predictive performance even to very large scale. The empirical results are based on data drawn from nine different predictive modeling applications, from book reviews to banking transactions. This study provides a clear illustration that larger data indeed can be more valuable assets for predictive analytics. This implies that institutions with larger data assets - plus the skill to take advantage of them - potentially can obtain substantial competitive advantage over institutions without such access or skill. Moreover, the results suggest that it is worthwhile for companies with access to such fine-grained data, in the context of a key predictive task, to gather both more data instances and more possible data features. As an additional contribution, we introduce an implementation of the multivariate Bernoulli Naïve Bayes algorithm that can scale to massive, sparse data.

However, there remains a dearth of empirical evidence that highlight how software Small to Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) operationalise their approach to knowledge management (KM) as a means of preparing themselves for the future. For an SME, the first step is to take stock of the types of knowledge that are valuable to the business, where it is stored and how it is used. In addition, consideration must be given to knowledge activities (KA), the constituent parts, of a company's KM approach. By doing this, the organisation can identify where its strengths lie in terms of the type and extent to which knowledge is managed through acquisition, codification, storage, maintenance, transfer and creation activities. Using a qualitative analysis approach in a single case study, this chapter identifies occurrences of these knowledge activities as a means of assessing an SME's approach to KM with a view to better facilitating an organisation's ability to be increasingly flexible in the face of a changing environment.

In particular, it is widely acknowledged that client briefing is an intractable problem which many projects encounter. Primarily this is because little attention is given to assessing the needs of the client, stakeholders and those of the design team. With this in mind, this paper presents a soft system approach known as strategic needs analysis (SNA) to assist clients, stakeholders and their design teams in determining their strategic needs for a given project. The rationale for using a SNA approach during the early stages of the project development process and in relation to the strategic environment of the client organization is presented and discussed. The SNA process is described and applied to two case study projects. It is concluded that SNA can improve the strategic decision-making process of a project, as clients are able to identify their strategic needs and thus improve the effectiveness of the briefing process. © 2001, MCB UP Limited To build or not to build?

This approach suggests that different media have, at the same time, both unique attributes (which allow them to exist as complements in a portfolio of choices) and similarities (which allow users to substitute one medium for another when needed). A survey was conducted to identify the key determinants of media choice among managers and professionals in Singapore. Results suggest that media choice is multidimensional and not nearly as dichotomous as media richness theory suggests. For example, the same medium-telephones-can play a dual role depending on the circumstances: as a substitute for face-to-face communication (among heavy e-mail users or among lower level employees) and as a complement to other media such as e-mail or written communication.

The cross-disciplinary application of attribution theory to, for example, organizational behavior, marketing, and education, has stimulated the interests of researchers and contributed to its theoretical validity and reliability. Compared to other disciplines, the application and theoretical testing of attribution theory are in the \"spring\" of their existence in the field of Information Systems (IS).

We first identify the causal attributions that enterprise resource planning (ERP) users make for their computer performance histories. We then describe the conceptualization and development of multi-item scales to capture these causal attributions. This work contributes to theory and practice through (1) the development and psychometric testing of several attributional scales for advancing our understanding of the multitheoretical stream of research investigating technology adoption at the individual level, and (2) by providing a description of a theoretical multimethod approach for the rigorous scale development of causal attributions.

Methods Immunohistochemical SP method was used to detect the expression of FGF-2 and OPN in 76 patients with NSCLC and 15 normal lung tissues. The effect of FGF-2 on OPN expression at mRNA and protein level in A549 cell was examined by RT-PCR and Western blot. Results The positive expression of FGF-2 (65.8%) and OPN (60.5%) in the NSCLC tissues was significantly higher than that in the normal lung tissues (13.3% and 0, respectively) (P < 0.01). The expression of FGF-2 and OPN was closely related to TNM stages and the lymph node metastasis (all Ps < 0.01), but not to histological types, sex, and age of NSCLC patients (all Ps > 0.05). A positive correlation was found between the expression of FGF-2 and OPN in NSCLC (r = 0.552, P < 0.01). The expression of OPN protein and mRNA was up-regulated by FGF-2 in A549 cells. Conclusion The overexpression of FGF-2 and OPN is related to the metas-tasis and invasion of NSCLC.

Research has tended to marginalise the importance of this communication change, possibly because of the lack of appropriate models for evaluating communication effectiveness. This paper therefore seeks to develop and apply such an evaluative model, which is underpinned by communication theory. The context of application is e-mortgage lending - based on the selection of two banks' interfaces - as evidence suggests that this type of e-commerce activity presents difficulties in electronic communication where, for example, the customer need for face-to-face mortgage advice prevails. Findings from the model's application reveal that whilst users respond socially to the interfaces, a number of communication problems can be identified by theme. Reflection is provided on the model's usefulness for evaluating the effectiveness of customers' online communication experiences. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The happy-productive worker thesis states that happy workers are more productive. Recent research in software engineering supports the thesis, and the ideal of flourishing happiness among software developers is often expressed among industry practitioners. However, the literature suggests that a cost-effective way to foster happiness and productivity among workers could be to limit unhappiness. Psychological disorders such as job burnout and anxiety could also be reduced by limiting the negative experiences of software developers. Simultaneously, a baseline assessment of (un)happiness and knowledge about how developers experience it are missing. In this paper, we broaden the understanding of unhappiness among software developers in terms of (1) the software developer population distribution of (un)happiness, and (2) the causes of unhappiness while developing software. We conducted a large-scale quantitative and qualitative survey, incorporating a psychometrically validated instrument for measuring (un)happiness, with 2 220 developers, yielding a rich and balanced sample of 1318 complete responses. Our results indicate that software developers are a slightly happy population, but the need for limiting the unhappiness of developers remains. We also identified 219 factors representing causes of unhappiness while developing software. Our results, which are available as open data, can act as guidelines for practitioners in management positions and developers in general for fostering happiness on the job. We suggest considering happiness in future studies of both human and technical aspects in software engineering.

After distinguishing between rigorous definitions of service and treatment of service as an analytical lens, this paper presents a framework that distinguishes between four lenses for understanding and analyzing services and systems in the IS field. Each lens is directly applicable to many situations, and less applicable elsewhere. This paper summarizes each lens and identifies potential synergies between pairs of lenses. The synergies may help in using secondary lenses to support analyses guided by a primary lens. The range of lenses helps in understanding the range of meanings of service in IS.

One specific classification of IS/ IT is recognised in the form of electronic commerce (e-commerce) which organisations are using to revolutionalise their business models. This paper defines and analyses such systems and considers their impact on competitive 'virtual' trading. It argues, in particular, the relationship between ecommerce and its potential influence on the value chain. The motivation for the paper is to consider the impacts such systems have on business performance. In this respect it is believed that their nature is recognised as offering different guidelines on approaches to organisational strategy.

The results of our empirical study show that the depth and breadth of IOS deployment enhance a firm's competitive performance through operational improvement, and the balanced alignment between IOS depth and breadth enhances the firm's competitive performance.

Research on the performance of new ventures increasingly investigates initial resources as determinants of success. Initial resources are said to be important because they imprint the firm at start-up, limit its strategic choices, and continue to impact its performance in the long run. The purpose of this paper is to identify configurations of initial resource bundles, strategy and environment that lead to superior performance in start-ups. To date, interdependencies between resources on the one hand and between resources, strategy and environment on the other hand have been neglected in empirical research. We rely on data mining for the analysis because it accounts for premises of configurational theory, including reversed causality, intradimensional interactions, multidimensional dependencies, and equifinality. We apply advanced data mining techniques, in the form of rule extraction from non-linear support vector machines, to induce accurate and comprehensible configurations of resource bundles, strategy and environment. We base our analysis on an extensive survey among 218 Flemish start-ups. Our experiments indicate the good performance of rule extraction technique ALBA.

At the methodological core of process-centered management is process modeling. However, business process modeling in large initiatives can be a time-consuming and costly exercise, making it potentially difficult to convince executive management of its benefits. To date, and despite substantial interest and research in the area of process modeling, the understanding of the actual benefits of process modeling in academia and practice is limited. To address this gap, this paper explores the perception of benefits derived from process modeling initiatives, as reported through a global Delphi study. The study incorporates the views of three groups of stakeholders - academics, practitioners and vendors. Our findings lead to the first identification and ranking of 19 unique benefits associated with process modeling. The study in particular found that process modeling benefits vary significantly between practitioners and academics. We argue that the variations may point to a disconnect between research projects and practical demands. © Springer-Verlag 2009. Business process modeling: Perceived benefits', 'Background. Quantitative prospective methods are widely used to evaluate the impact of new technologies such as electronic prescribing (eP) on medication errors. However, they are labour-intensive and it is not always feasible to obtain pre-intervention data. Our objective was to compare the eP medication error picture obtained with retrospective quantitative and qualitative methods. Methods. The study was carried out at one English district general hospital approximately two years after implementation of an integrated electronic prescribing, administration and records system. Quantitative: A structured retrospective analysis was carried out of clinical records and medication orders for 75 randomly selected patients admitted to three wards (medicine, surgery and paediatrics) six months after eP implementation. Qualitative: Eight doctors, 6 nurses, 8 pharmacy staff and 4 other staff at senior, middle and junior grades, and 19 adult patients on acute surgical and medical wards were interviewed. Staff interviews explored experiences of developing and working with the system; patient interviews focused on experiences of medicine prescribing and administration on the ward. Interview transcripts were searched systematically for accounts of medication incidents. A classification scheme was developed and applied to the errors identified in the records review. Results. The two approaches produced similar pictures of the drug use process. Interviews identified types of error identified in the retrospective notes review plus two eP-specific errors which were not detected by record review. Interview data took less time to collect than record review, and provided rich data on the prescribing process, and reasons for delays or non-administration of medicines, including \"once only\" orders and \"as required\" medicines. Conclusions. The qualitative approach provided more understanding of processes, and some insights into why medication errors can happen. The method is cost-effective and could be used to supplement information from anonymous error reporting schemes. © 2010 Savage et al.

One characteristic of such communication is the use of references. Yet, scientific communities differ in the ways their members use citations to position their own contribution. In this paper, we examine the following questions: What can we learn about the discursive practices within IS by investigating ways in which the community has drawn upon one of its classics? How can such an analysis inform us as authors, reviewers, and active members of the discipline? To address these questions, we analyze over 300 citations extending over two decades to one of the most widely-cited works in the field - Markus\\'s \"Power, Politics, and MIS Implementation\". We apply a wide range of citation analysis techniques to understand how IS researchers have used the article to support or to frame their contribution. Our analysis reveals the impact of social construction in shaping our discursive practices. This observation has several implications for improving IS research.

Following up on on a community-based initiative, designed to stimulate computer literacy and access to information and communication technologies for residents and neighbors of an underserved public housing community, a survey of egovernment website awareness and visitation was undertaken. The results indicate that although nearly half of the respondents are neither aware of nor have visited e-government websites, the majority of respondents are partaking in egovernment services. The top categories of e-government website awareness and visitation are transportation, employment, recreation, and children's services. The contribution of this research is to validate that benefits of e-government services can be brought to members and neighbors of a techno-disadvantaged community. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of the community-based initiative to foster awareness and visitation of e-government websites, thereby advancing egovernment inclusion.

It will be proven that the adoption of EDI by the supplier can result in the positive externalities for the buyer and negative externalities for the other suppliers. It will also be shown that although EDI reduces the transaction costs of the buyer, the upstream market tends to become more concentrated as a result of the increased cost differentials. Electronic data interchange: competitive externalities and strategic implementation policies', \"The development of electronic government (eGovernment) systems that enable citizens to transact with governments on-line has brought about a focus on the management of citizen's electronic identity. Identity management (IdM) becomes a key issue in the electronic world where government systems need to prove a citizens' identity in order to provide access to government services. To date, there isn't a standard identity and authentication architecture that governments can easily deploy to support their eGovernment implementations. Citizen users of such systems also need to establish trust and confidence in the on-line service to avoid problems that can arise with phishing or identity theft. Some IdM solutions such as those based on biometrics can not serve all citizens equally and are thus difficult for governments to deploy in a manner which preserves inclusiveness and accessibility of the services. Other issues such as the global mobility of citizens further complicates the issue of remote IdM as citizens may wish to access their respective eGovernment services from any part of the globe. There are clearly many computer security and privacy challenges to creating a globally acceptable solution. In this paper we classify and analyse currently available authentication technologies and their associated risks while presenting key identification and authentication requirements from a government's perspective. Our analysis leads us to suggest specific enhancements to Shared and Federated Authentication System that make impersonation difficult, or impossible.

Retail sales employees are often trained to examine a consumer's searching behavior in determining their likelihood to purchase. It would seem, therefore, that such a similar correlation should occur in the online setting. Namely, consumes'r search behavior should be related to their likelihood to purchase. However, does search behavior offer any information in the online setting? It is this question that we explore in this paper. In addition, we investigate how the relationship between search and purchase behavior differs at different levels of analysis, extended search, and session-level search. We find that in the aggregate, when taking extended search into account, search breadth and depth are both positively associated with purchase behavior, suggesting that the extended search process is positively associated with purchase behavior. When we drill down to the session level, separating the sessions by person, we find that search breadth is negatively associated with amount spent online, whereas search depth is positively associated with amount spent online. These results show that a relationship exists between search behavior and purchase behavior. In addition, the results suggest that firms should examine both extended search and session-level search when assessing their consumer base.

While acknowledging the significant contribution that this model has made, it is suggested that it does not go far enough - the dimensions of SERVQUAL do not adequately address some of the more critical issues associated with the assessment of individual services. Having carried out citation analyses of both the 1985 and 1988 versions of SERVQUAL, it can be shown that although there is a plethora of published work in the marketing and retail sectors about its applicability, relatively little empirical work has been carried out in other service sectors. Indeed, more than one-quarter of all published papers where SERVQUAL was a major theme, appear to have severe reservations about this scale. In place of the SERVQUAL scale, a model which takes the form of a hierarchical structure - based on three main levels of attributes - pivotal, core, and peripheral (P-C-P) is proposed. This P-C-P model has the ability to span any service sector since what is proposed is a skeletal framework within which to consider respective services. The authors are currently in the process of using this model for the empirical analysis of the quality of information which is provided by government bodies to the business community. The results of their empirical study will form the subject matter of the next paper in this series. This is, therefore, largely theoretical in nature with the emphasis on a critical appraisal of the existing models in the service quality arena and it also describes the authors' own model to encourage discussion and debate among researchers, perhaps allowing them to make further refinements to their proposed model. © MCB UP Ltd.

Conceptual models are the means by which a designer expresses his or her understanding of an envisioned information system. This research investigates whether modeling experts or novices differ in understanding conceptual models represented by textual descriptions in the form of narratives, by generalpurpose conceptual modeling languages, such as entity-relationship models or by pattern-based conceptual modeling languages. Cognitive science theories on memory systems are adopted and a cued recall experiment carried out. The experimental results suggest that narratives cannot be underestimated during learning processes in information systems design. Furthermore, general-purpose conceptual modeling languages tend to lack capabilities for supporting template-based learning.

A System dynamics approach as a predictive tool maps complex relationships among the healthcare processes into a model by which one can dynamically measure the effect of any changes in the parameters over time. The System dynamics model's objective is to analyze the impact of EHRs in a healthcare setting during and after its implementation. Simulation of EHR implementations using system dynamics model produces useful data on the benefits of EHRs that are hard to obtain through empirical data collection methods.

Using the natural resource-based view (NRBV) and signaling theory, we conducted an event study using the Fama-French four-factor (FFM4) model to determine how shareholders react to company announcements about adopting information technology (IT) to address environmental issues. We found that green IT announcements generate positive abnormal returns and increase share trading volume. Initiatives that use IT to support decision making (ITDSS) cause positive stock market reactions. Firms with good environmental performance records enjoy positive market returns from ITDSS and direct IT assets and infrastructure (ITASSETS) announcements. In contrast, shareholders react negatively to announcements regarding sustainable products and services (SPDTSVC). Combining the NRBV with signaling theory provides deeper theoretical insights than either theory alone. The findings could serve as the basis for further research and theory development on the different types of green IT and impacts on market value. The results help explain how firm characteristics and different types of green IT announcements impact market value, and they have significant implications for how firms plan and allocate their resources to support green initiatives.

Our study examines the intertwining of cognition and a specific emotion, regret, in IT real options decision making using a multisite case study of IT investments. We develop a process model that explains the context in which regret is triggered, the strategies used to regulate regret, and how these strategies influence the valuation, creation, exercise, and revaluation of several types of IT real options. Our research highlights that while some regret regulation strategies may be productive, others are counterproductive. Our findings extend the studies on cognition-based models of IT real options by including emotion, which allows us to explore human behavior on a psychological level and offer a more fundamental understanding of IT real options thinking.

Though both standards are based on the same technological foundation, there are some significant differences as to the goals that their developers intend to achieve through their use. Mobile phones are the most popular personal devices world-wide, with roughly three billion units in operation as of 2006. Market researchers are anticipating that by 2012 20% of all sold phones will be NFC enabled. With 300 million NFC phones sold in 2012, mobile phones would become the largest infrastructure of RFID readers world wide. On the other side, EPC tags will steadily become more available on logistical units and consumer products. The fact that more than a billion consumers might be equipped with NFC enabled mobile phones by 2015 raises the question whether the compatibility of EPC item level tags to these devices would not offer significant benefits.

These linkages are often documented as process flow diagrams that connect the data inputs and outputs of individuals. In such a connected setting, the differences among individuals in preference for data attributes such as timeliness, accuracy, etc., can cause data quality problems. For example, individuals at the head of a process flow may bear all the cost of capturing high quality data but may not receive all of the benefits although the rest of the organization benefits from their diligence. Consequently, these individuals, in absence of any managerial intervention, may not invest enough in data quality.

Before informed investors submit their bids, they know that, in the aggregate, winning bidders will receive only a fraction of their demand. We demonstrate that this mitigates the winner's curse, that is, the incentive of bidders to shade their bids. It leads to more aggressive bidding, to the extent that rationing can be revenue-enhancing. In a parametric example, we characterize bid and revenue functions, and the optimal degree of rationing. We show that, when investors' information is diffuse, maximal rationing is optimal. Conversely, when their information is concentrated, the seller should not ration shares. We provide testable predictions on bid dispersion and the degree of rationing.

These types of collaborative interactions where services are co-created between service providers and customers are under-researched, yet they are a growing phenomenon within professional services organisations. In particular, little is known about how IS can be used to facilitate co-creation interactions. The more that IS are used to facilitate customer interactions, the less scope there is for individually tailoring or co-creating service offerings with customers in a manor traditionally associated with person-to-person customer relationship strategies. This is argued to be a major obstacle, as organisations increasingly seek to use technology in their interactions with customers. Using Activity Theory as an analytical lens to view extant research, the paper develops a conceptual model for service co-creation. This model will guide empirical research in several Financial Service organisations with the aim of improving extant understanding of service co-creation and, specifically, the role of IS in this process.

The emphasis on expertise alignment in this study suggests the importance not of simply having a transactive memory system, but rather, of having an accurate transactive memory system in place. Using experimental data from a sample of 134 participants, the results indicate that the knowledge transfer is greater in the source's cognitive-social expertise alignment than in the misalignment, but the source's cognitive expertise could be a more significant criterion for the knowledge transfer in the expertise misalignment. In the view of source-recipient dynamics, knowledge transfer is greater in the low cognitive expertise gap condition than in the high cognitive expertise gap condition.

Our aim was to assess the role of gastrin in oxyntic mucosal inflammation in H. pylori-infected Mongolian gerbils by means of the gastrin receptor antagonist netazepide (YF476). Design: We studied 60 gerbils for 18 months and left five animals uninfected (control group), inoculated 55 with H. pylori, and treated 28 of the infected animals with netazepide (Hp+YF476 group). Twenty-seven infected animals were given no treatment (Hp group). We measured plasma gastrin and intraluminal pH. H. pylori detection and histologic evaluations of the stomach were carried out. Results: All 55 inoculated animals were H. pylori positive at termination. Eighteen animals in the Hp group had gastritis. There was a threefold increase in mucosal thickness in the Hp group compared to the Hp+YF476 group, and a threefold increase in oxyntic neuroendocrine cells in the Hp group compared to the Hp+YF476 group (p < .05). All animals in the Hp+YF476 group had macro- and microscopically normal findings in the stomach. Plasma gastrin was higher in the Hp group than in the control group (172 ± 16 pmol/L vs 124 ± 5 pmol/L, p < .05) and highest in the Hp+YF476 group (530 ± 36 pmol/L). Intraluminal pH was higher in the Hp group than in the Hp+YF476 group (2.51 vs 2.30, p < .05). Conclusion: The gastrin antagonist netazepide prevents H. pylori-induced gastritis in Mongolian gerbils. Thus, gastrin has a key role in the inflammatory reaction of the gastric mucosa to H. pylori infection in this species. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The results have pragmatic implications, suggesting it is possible to crowd source design, and providing new ways of eliciting, testing, and training expertise. More generally, the paper suggests a new model for information system design based on analogical mapping. Matching mechanisms to situations through the wisdom of the crowd\", 'Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Due to significant adverse effects and emergence of resistant strains of currently developed anti-HCV agents, plant extracts have been considered to be potential sources of new bioactive compounds against HCV. The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional effects of triterpenoid saponins contained in the root extract of Platycodon grandiflorum (PG) on viral enzyme activities and replication in both HCV replicon cells and cell culture grown HCV- (HCVcc-) infected cells. Inhibitory activities of triterpenoid saponins from PG were verified by NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase assay and were further confirmed in the context of HCV replication. Six triterpenoid saponins (platycodin D, platycodin D 2, platycodin D3, deapioplatycodin D, deapioplatycodin D2, and platyconic acid A), PG saponin mixture (PGSM), were identified as active components exerting anti-HCV activity. Importantly, PGSM exerted synergistic anti-HCV activity in combination with either interferon- or NS5A inhibitors. We demonstrated that combinatorial treatment of PGSM and IFN- efficiently suppressed colony formation with significant reduction in drug resistant variant of HCV. These data suggest that triterpenoid saponin may represent a novel anti-HCV therapeutic agent. © 2013 Jong-Woo Kim et al. Triterpenoid saponins isolated from Platycodon grandiflorum inhibit Hepatitis C virus replication', \"Extant explanations of why users behave in particular ways toward information technologies have tended to focus predominantly on instrumental beliefs as drivers of individual usage intentions. Prior work in individual psychology, however, suggests that holistic experiences with technology as captured in constructs such as enjoyment and flow are potentially important explanatory variables in technology acceptance theories. In this paper, we describe a multi-dimensional construct labeled cognitive absorption and defined as a state of deep involvement with software. Cognitive absorption, theorized as being exhibited through the five dimensions of temporal dissociation, focused immersion, heightened enjoyment, control, and curiosity, is posited to be a proximal antecedent of two important beliefs about technology use: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. In addition, we propose that the individual traits of playfulness and personal innovativeness are important determinants of cognitive absorption. Based on the conceptual definition of this construct, operational measures for each dimension are developed. Using the World Wide Web as the target technology, scale validation indicates that the operational measures have acceptable psychometric properties and confirmatory factor analysis supports the proposed multi-dimensional structure. Structural equation analysis provides evidence for the theorized nomological net of cognitive absorption. Theoretical and practical implications are offered. Time flies when you're having fun: Cognitive absorption and beliefs about information technology usage\", '© 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to apply the theoretical lens of liminality to a consideration of non-traditional entrepreneurial locations. The study exemplifies such locations by empirically exploring self-storage based businesses: that is, businesses that operate for a significant number of hours each week from self-storage facilities. Design/methodology/approach – The study draws on interviews with entrepreneurs operating self-storage based businesses and operators of self-storage facilities. The interview data is supported by site visits, businesses’ websites, promotional and marketing materials and press coverage. Findings – Consistent with the liminal lens, entrepreneurs view their time operating from self-storage as a transitional phase. They do not suffer the high levels of uncertainty and unsettledness usually associated with liminality. However, they experience anxiety related to perceptions of operating from a business location outside the mainstream. Whilst the entrepreneurs benefit from additional services provided by the self-storage operators, this may be at the expense of extra “liminal” work and anxiety experienced by the storage operators’ staff. Originality/value – The study contributes to entrepreneurship by answering Steyaert and Katz’s (2004) call for studies in unfamiliar places and spaces. The authors identify a number of ways in which liminality can arise when considering entrepreneurial locations. Drawing on extant entrepreneurial studies, the authors theorise that idiosyncratic characteristics of such spaces attract entrepreneurs with particular personal characteristics and needs, who will in turn be influenced by those spaces. In the case of self-storage facilities, the liminal space allows trepidatious entrepreneurs to “try on” (Hawkins and Edwards, 2015, p. 39) operating a new venture. Entrepreneurship and liminality: the case of self-storage based businesses', 'Design research and the literature on sociomateriality emerge out of different academic traditions but share a common interest in the material. A sociomaterial perspective allows us to account for the complex ways people mingle and mangle information systems of all sorts into their social endeavors to accomplish organizational tasks. But, how do we account for these sociomaterial phenomena in all their complexity when faced with the task of designing information systems? The panel brings together prominent researchers bridging the gap between design research and the current debate on sociomateriality. Each presenter addresses the challenges associated with informing grounded design work with insights from a highly abstract intellectual debate. Sociomateriality and design', \"Literature reviews are central to any academic research. Whether journal article, conference presentation or research thesis it is necessary for all of them to provide an overview of earlier research in order to contextualize one's own findings. More fundamentally, the beginning of any research is crucially dependent on an appropriate literature review. In recent years a supposedly new form of literature review has emerged, so called, systematic reviews. The aim of this paper is to question the key premises of systematic reviews and demonstrate that the claims they are less biased and more rigorous than so called narrative reviews do not hold. This paper briefly introduces the origin of systematic reviews and explains how they are undertaken. Based on this introduction the paper shows that key premises of systematic reviews cannot be fulfilled and that they by no means guaranty the creation of 'better' literature reviews. In contrast, to systematic reviews which put importance on the literature identification and selection process, it argues that reading is central to reviewing literature. Reading enables academics to improve their understanding of the subject area and therefore to further advance their searches. Better literature reviews can only be achieved through better understanding of the subject area. Proper understanding of search techniques will then allow researchers to identify further relevant literature. Reviewing literature is therefore better described as a hermeneutic process. Are systematic reviews better, less biased and of higher quality?\", 'For organizations engaged in electronic business, the corporate website has emerged as the single most important interface through which transactions are carried out. This being so, appropriate design characteristics are required to make websites effective. Customers expect websites to be designed differently, depending on the task and purpose associated with the website. This paper identifies and analyzes important characteristics of the 40 most successful websites from five different categories: Retail, Financial Services, News & Information, Search & Portal and Entertainment. The findings indicate that there are six critical characteristics of websites and the relative importance of these characteristics varies across categories. The paper explains these results and based on them, develops managerial implications and guidelines for website design. Analysis of critical website characteristics: A cross-category study of successful websites', 'Using data envelopment analysis (DEA) this study attempts to compare the relative efficiencies of supply chain management (SCM) and information system (IS) practices of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in food products and beverages in two neighbouring South East European countries, Turkey and Bulgaria. While there exist some significant differences between the efficiency level of SCM practices and the country of origin of the sample firms, no significant differences were found between the efficiency levels of both IS practices and the composite variable of SCMIS practices, and the country of origin of the SMEs. Turkish SMEs tend to achieve higher efficiency level with respect to the implementation of SCM practices. There are also significant differences in returns to scale for each group of input variables with respect to the country of origin of the SMEs. The analysis of the improvement potential of inputs indicates that Bulgarian SMEs place more emphasis on managing most of the SCM practices to enhance their SCM efficiency. However, no statistically significant differences in general were noted between both groups of firms with regard to the level of resources and efforts exerted on IS and SCM and IS practices. In terms of the overall average of output deficits, Turkish SMEs were found to have significantly higher output deficits than Bulgarian SMEs with respect to all three groups of input variables. An efficiency comparison of supply chain management and information systems practices: A study of Turkish and Bulgarian small- and medium-sized enterprises in food products and beverages', 'The recent growth of business-to-consumer (B2C) Internet auctions challenges researchers to develop empirically-sound explanations of critical factors that allow merchants to earn price premiums in these auctions. The absence of a comprehensive model of Internet auctions leads us to conduct an exploratory study to elucidate and rank critical factors that lead to price premiums in Internet auctions. We employ Classification and Regression Trees (CART), a decision-tree induction technique, to analyze data collected in a field study of eBay auctions. Our analysis yields decision trees that visually depict noteworthy factors that may lead to price premiums and that indicate the relative importance of these factors. We find shipping cost, reputation, initial bid price, and auction ending time as the factors most predictive of price premiums in B2C Internet auctions. © 2009, IGI Global.

Process virtualization is having profound effects on society, as an increasing number of both business and nonbusiness processes such as those related to education, medicine, and dating are being migrated to virtual environments. There is a vast literature that relates to process virtualization topics, but it is fragmented across different domains. The purpose of this paper is to propose a research agenda to develop high-level theories and frameworks that inform the general process virtualization phenomenon. Developing these theories and frameworks will synthesize existing knowledge and provide a theoretical foundation upon which to add new knowledge as it is created. This will help policy makers maximize the substantial benefits of virtual processes while minimizing the risks. Given the background, interests, and skills of IS scholars, the IS discipline is well suited to lead in this endeavor. © 2010 INFORMS. The design, use, and consequences of virtual processes', 'NPL is developing a new clock algorithm to combine measurements from its three active hydrogen masers and caesium fountain clock. The algorithm takes advantage of recent developments, in particular the use of covariance reduction techniques. This algorithm differs from previous Kalman filter clock algorithms in that it has been designed to operate near optimally in the presence of flicker frequency modulation (FFM). The aim of the work is to produce a composite clock that over a wide range of averaging times has near optimal stability. This is achieved by modelling the FFM approximately by a linear combination of Markov noise processes. Each Markov process is included in the Kalman filter and contributes an additional component to the state vector. Both the validity of the model and the effectiveness of adding these additional components to the state vector are examined. To apply a Kalman filter clock algorithm to real clock data, it is first necessary to estimate the noise parameters used in the process covariance matrix. An iterative method had been developed previously [2] to resolve the magnitude of noise parameters from a measurement time series. This method is extended through the use of wavelet variances, and then applied to a \"three cornered hat\" of hydrogen maser measurements. Several aspects of the implementation of the algorithm are discussed, including the mechanism for adding and removing clocks, and the treatment of missing data. The performance of the new algorithm is examined when applied to simulated measurements and also to measurements from NPL\\'s three hydrogen masers. The latter is achieved through comparisons against NPL\\'s caesium fountain clock and against external UTC timescales using two-way time transfer measurements. The development of a Kalman filter clock algorithm', \"The quality of Information Systems (IS) education may be suffering because some university IS departments are not providing a systematic method for preparing and motivating Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs). This paper proposes a GTA motivational reengineering program based on several well-accepted theories of motivation. The short-term and long-term costs of the proposed program are also evaluated. By implementing this program, IS GTAs should become more satisfied, better equipped, and deliver higher quality education to IS students.

An essential part of trigger execution is detection and resolution of cycles. This paper presents an approach to determine the terminability of a cycle introduced by a BPTrigger in a business process and determine whether a cycle is allowable in terms of compensatibility. The foundation of the approach is a set of conditions for cycle termination derived from classifications of business processes by resource usage and activity types by compensation status. This paper formally presents cycle analysis procedures using the notion of cycle analysis graph. Further, a procedure is proposed which checks the terminability of multiple cycles using a composite cycle analysis graph constructed from the cycle analysis graphs of the associated cycles. The paper proves the correctness of the analysis and presents a validation example. The presented results extend some limitations of well-formed sphere which has addressed atomicity of workflow transactions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Globalization and small/firearms: A public health perspective', 'Application development on wireless sensor networks is becoming more and more challenging due to increasing complexity of applications and lack of dedicated programming models. Developers should concentrate on the application logic, while network designers should ensure the network and sensor performance. However, in reality, these two roles often overlap because the architectural and programming abstraction between the network and application is missing. Research on middleware and language that bridges these two abstraction levels is still in a preliminary stage. This paper proposes a macro language based on our previous work COPAL (COntext Provisioning for ALl). COPAL is a runtime context provisioning middleware that, via a loosely-coupled and composable architecture, ensures context information from wireless sensor networks and other sources can be processed for the needs of context-aware applications. COPAL-ML is a macro language that extends Java programming language and is tailored for the application development using COPAL. Its main task is to reduce development efforts, hide the inherent complexity of COPAL API, and separate concerns of the context-aware application from underlining wireless sensor network. © 2011 ACM.

Democracy in Australia is gravely threatened by a flood of measures harmful to human rights that have been introduced since 2001, a large proportion of which are unjustified and not subject to effective controls. The passage of these measures through the Parliament has been achieved on the basis of their proponents' assertions and without appropriate scrutiny. Parliament had available to it various forms of impact assessment techniques, but failed to require that such methods be applied. The study reported here had as its focus one particular form of evaluation - Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA). The study found that the PIA process should have been performed for each proposal, but was in fact seldom applied, and where it was applied the process and report were in almost all cases seriously deficient. Survival of democracy is dependent on the Parliament standing up to the national security extremism that has taken hold of the Attorney-General's Department. Ministers and Parliamentary Committees must demand prior evaluation of proposals that restrict civil freedoms, must ensure transparency in relation to the proposals and their justification, and must require effective controls over, and mitigation features within, those measures that survive the evaluation process. Privacy impact assessments as a control mechanism for Australian counter-terrorism initiatives\", 'Iris is rich of texture information for reliable personal identification. However, nonlinear deformation of iris pattern caused by pupil dilation or contraction raises a grand challenge to iris recognition. This paper proposes a novel iris recognition method namely Deformable DAISY Matcher (DDM) for robust iris feature matching. Firstly, dense DAISY descriptors are extracted to represent regional iris features, which are robust against intra-class variations of iris images. Then a set of iris key points are localized on the feature map. Finally deformation tolerant matching strategy is proposed to match corresponding key points of iris images. Experimental results on two iris image databases demonstrate DDM is better than state-of-the-art iris recognition methods. © 2011 IEEE. Deformable DAISY matcher for robust iris recognition', 'Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the knowledge generation in a cross-disciplinary group in Norway that developed a new medical device. The aim is to shed light on how knowledge was generated and how the relationships between different communities of practice were mediated. In particular, the paper seeks to examine how material objects and contextual conditions influenced the innovation process. Design/methodology/approach - In this longitudinal case study an innovation process was followed for five years, and the research material was constructed through extensive observations, interviews and document analysis. Findings - The innovation process exhibited different themes in varying degrees of blend throughout the process. First, the practices of constructing the device and ascertaining technical feasibility are described. Then the enacted nature of the work is outlined; how it was significantly dependent on circumstantial factors, but also strongly shaped by the need to ensure clinical usability of the device. Finally, the work to package the innovation and turn it into a commercial product is explored. Originality/value - In contrast with many previous studies, this study follows large parts of the innovation process, and it emphasises how knowing and practice are a result of networked, and changing, relations between both human and non-human actors. Rather than one community of practice emerging around the innovation work, what can be called an object-centred assemblage of communities of practice was seen, which grew and changed according to the changing nature of knowledge needs for the project to continue and succeed. This has interesting implications for the understanding of cross-disciplinary innovation processes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. Constructing, enacting and packaging innovations', \"User involvement in the design of computer-based information systems is broadly accepted as one of the essential principles of information systems development. The MIS literature has devoted considerable attention to the relationship between user involvement and MIS success. In reviewing this literature, Ives and Olson find that user involvement research is characterized by weak measures and conflicting results. They contend that the lack of a conceptual foundation to guide measurement development and the absence of a rigorous program of measurement validation limit our understanding of the nature and efficacy of user involvement. In the near future, much of the use of computers by non-data processing processionals will be conducted in an end-user computing environment. This paper describes efforts to develop an instrument for measuring end-user involvement in the development of a specific application. A factor analysis reveals three dimensions of end-user involvement identified as systems analysis, implementation, and administration. Discriminant validity of these factors is assessed. Using partial correlation, the relative efficacy of involvement in systems analysis vis-à-vis implementation or administration is examined. The results suggest an eight item involvement scale that focuses on project initiation and systems analysis activities. Evidence of the instrument's reliability and validity by nature and type of application is presented. © 1990. The measurement of end-user software involvement\", \"Prior research concerning IT business value has established a link between firm-level IT investment and tangible returns such as output productivity. Research also suggests that IT is vital to intermediate processes such as those that produce intangible output. Among these, the use of IT in innovation and knowledge creation processes is perhaps the most critical to a firm's long-term success. However, little is known about the relationship between IT, knowledge creation, and innovation output. In this study, we contribute to the literature by comprehensively examining the contribution of IT to innovation production across multiple contexts using a quality-based measure of innovation output. Analyzing annual information from 1987 to 1997 for a panel of large U.S. manufacturing firms, we find that a 10% increase in IT input is associated with a 1.7% increase in innovation output for a given level of innovation-related spending. This relationship between IT, research and development (R&D), and innovation production is robust across multiple econometric methodologies and is found to be particularly strong in the mid to late 1990s, a period of rapid technological innovation. Our results also demonstrate the importance of IT in creating value at an intermediate stage of production, in this case, through improved innovation productivity. However, R&D and its related intangible factors (skill, knowledge, etc.) appear to play a more crucial role in the creation of breakthrough innovations. © 2012 INFORMS.

These developments have opened up opportunities for response agencies and NGOs to organize local community involvement. In this paper we focus on the question how citizen involvement can be proactively organized toward disaster relief and what kind of dilemmas may arise in this process. We studied Ready2Help, an online platform developed by the Dutch Red Cross. Bringing together 36.000 volunteers, the platform plays a significant role in addressing the current refugee crisis. In our analysis we demonstrate the platform's potential, but also note a tension between control and cooperation. Our results indicate that, in contrast to their initial objective, during the crisis the Red Cross falls back on principles of control to organize citizen response efforts. We end by discussing our future research agenda aimed at bridging formal and emergent citizen responses. Are you Ready2Help? Organizing voluntary community response to disaster\", 'Increasingly, firms source more complex and strategic as well as harder to codify information technology projects to low-cost offshore locations. Completing such projects successfully requires close collaboration among all participants. Yet, achieving such collaboration is extremely difficult because of the complexity of the context: multiple and overlapping boundaries associated with diverse organizational and national contexts separate the participants. These boundaries also lead to a pronounced imbalance of resources among onshore and offshore contributors giving rise to status differences and inhibiting collaboration. This research adopts a practice perspective to investigate how differences in country and organizational contexts give rise to boundaries and associated status differences in offshore application development projects and how these boundaries and status differences can be renegotiated in practice to establish effective collaboration. To illustrate and refine the theory, a qualitative case study of a large financial services firm, which sourced a variety of high-end IT work to its wholly owned subsidiaries (\"captive centers\") and to third party vendors in multiple global locations (in particular, to India and Russia), is presented. Using a grounded theory approach, the paper finds that differences in country contexts gave rise to a number of boundaries that inhibited collaboration effectiveness, while differences in organizational contexts were largely mediated through organizational practices that treated vendor centers and captive units similarly. It also shows that some key onshore managers were able to alleviate status differences and facilitate effective collaboration across diverse country contexts by drawing on their position and resources. Implications are drawn for the theory and practice of global software development and multiparty collaboration. Innovating or doing as told?
